#discount is pretty high since the max reward/loss comes after the game has ended, which is usually after 2-3 games.
#the policy still seems to vary a little bit between each run, which is obviously because our training strategy is chosen randomly, and our sets can't be too big because of computing time limitations.
#it seems that the algorithm want to draw is it has 16 or less score most of the time.
